### Data Exploration
This repository includes three datasets under investigation:

- [Users Dataset](Data_Exploration_Users.ipynb)
- [Products Dataset](Data_Exploration_Products.ipynb)
- [Transactions Dataset](Data_Exploration_Transactions.ipynb)

I have summarized the data quality issues and identified fields that require further clarification at the bottom of each file.

### SQL Queries (Using SQLite)

The following questions have been addressed using SQL queries:

- What are the top 5 brands by sales among users who have had their account for at least six months?
- What is the percentage of sales in the Health & Wellness category by generation?
- Which brand leads in the Dips & Salsa category?

For the SQL queries, refer to the [SQL Query document](SQL_Query.pdf) for detailed explanations.

### Communication with Stakeholders

For a summary of key findings and next steps, refer to the [Email](Email.pdf) that outlines communication with stakeholders.
